## __CS2102 - Object Oriented Design Concepts__ 
### Actual WPI's course offered in C-term 2016 by Professor Kathi Fisler

Failed miserably in this class before... I am back! Just self-studying based on whatever materials I can find online, as I gradually realized how important oop is the more exposed I am to the industry.
Side note: I couldn't get Java up and running in a linux environment so I ended up coding with Eclipse in Window, shame.

### Summary on Homeworks

#### Homework 1:
Simple class nesting and interface implements, then testing with JUnit test.
